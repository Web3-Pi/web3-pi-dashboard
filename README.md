# Web3 Pi Dashboard (on LCD)


***Introducing a unique hardware dashboard for Web3Pi project.*** 

The project allows for the installation of a colorful LCD in the Argon Neo 5 enclosure.
We have designed our own 3D model of the enclosure cover with a space for the display. The assembly is simple, using snap-fits, with no tools required. The models are open-source, so anyone can print them on a 3D printer. The source code is also open-source, allowing users to add new functionalities, customize it to their needs, or add support for new displays.

## Requirements

- Python >= 3.9
- Run on Raspberry Pi
- SPI interface enabled (default on Web3Pi image)
- 1.69" LCD display with ST7789V2 Driver
  - Waveshare 24382 - [product page](https://www.waveshare.com/1.69inch-lcd-module.htm)
  - Seeed Studio 104990802 - [product page](https://www.seeedstudio.com/1-69inch-240-280-Resolution-IPS-LCD-Display-Module-p-5755.html)
- (Optional) 3D printed model of Argon Neo 5 cover
- (Optional) Argon Neo 5 enclosure

## Assembly

### 1. Connect wires
Connect the display to the Raspberry Pi according to the diagram below.  
The colors of the cables may vary depending on the supplier and batch. Focus on the function and pin number, not the color.

Diagram is valid for Raspberry Pi 4 and Pi 5

If on Raspberry Pi 5 your LCD backlight is flickering connect `BL` to `3.3V PIN 17`

### 2. Mount display module

Mount the display in the printed enclosure cover. The display is held in place by four clips. Make sure all 3D printing support residues are removed and the surface to which the display adheres is flat. Install the display by sliding one side under the clips first, then pressing the other side down. Do not use excessive force to avoid damaging the display. The display should fit in easily.

Since each 3D printer may be calibrated differently, it may be necessary to adjust the scale of the 3D model in the slicer software before printing. Our prints are done on [Original Prusa i3 MK3S+](https://www.prusa3d.com/pl/produkt/drukarka-3d-original-prusa-i3-mk3s-3/).

### 3. Mount enclosure cover

Mount the enclosure cover and secure it with two screws. Make sure to arrange the cables inside the enclosure so they do not obstruct the fan and minimize interference with cooling.


## Installation

```shell
cd APPROPRIATE_DIRECTORY
git clone https://github.com/Web3-Pi/hardware-monitor.git
cd hardware-monitor
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
deactivate
```


## Simple use

To run the service, follow the steps below:

```shell
cd APPROPRIATE_DIRECTORY/hardware-monitor
source venv/bin/activate
python3 hwmonitor.py  # Ctrl-c to shut down the monitor
deactivate
```


## 3D Model

The models are free, so anyone can print them on a 3D printer.

## 3D Printing

We recommend printing with [PETG](https://botland.store/849-petg-filaments?manufacturers=devil-design,prusa&weight=1000-g&material=petg&diameter=1-75-mm) filament due to the high operating temperatures of the Raspberry Pi.  
To ensure the snap-fits print correctly, enable 'supports everywhere.'  
Use a 0.4 mm nozzle.  
0.2 mm layer height or smaller.  
Our models are printed on [Original Prusa i3 MK3S+](https://www.prusa3d.com/pl/produkt/drukarka-3d-original-prusa-i3-mk3s-3/)

If you do not have access to a 3D printer, you can order an online print from one of the providers such as [JLC3DP](https://jlc3dp.com/3d-printing-quote).   
There are various materials technology and you can choose from:
- FDM - ABS, ASA or PA12-CF
- MJF - PA16-HP Nylon
- SLS - 3201PA-F Nylon
